## Data files

* Data/primary
These are almost raw data files, with minimal processing to remove invalid data and to remove potentially identifying personal information.

* "online_valid-anon-data.csv" : data were extracted from qualtrics, and minimally processed with "0_online_validate-and-anonymise.R" to remove invalid responses (e.g. spam, met exclusion criteria). An explanation of the variables can be found in "/Data/reports/online_qualtrics-variable-names.csv"


## Data/processed
These are processed data files that have been given more useful names and labels, and have been re-organised to facilitate analysis.

* "comm-data.csv" : data from both online and in-person/live studies, relating to the communication task. Participants felt or watched videos of standardized touch expressions and tried to guess what the toucher was trying to communicate. There is one row for each touch/video + response. There were 6 unique touch expressions. For the online study, there are 6 rows per participant. For the live study, each touch was repeated 10 times, making 60 rows per participant. 
  + experiment: text. "felt touch" or "viewed touch", indicating the live or online study. 
  + PID: text. Unique participant ID. For the online study, this was generated by qualtrics.
  + group: text, "Control" or "ASD". Indicates which group the participant belongs to.
  + task: text, "forced choice" or "free text". Indicates which task condition the participant was randomly assigned to. Only online study participants could be assigned to the "free text" task. 
  + Experimenter: integer 1-3, a code indicating which of three trained experimenters delivered the touch expressions.
  + trial: integer, 1-60. Indicates the trial order, the order in which the touches/videos were presented to each participant. Max 6 when experiment is "viewed touch"
  + cued: text, "attention", "happiness", "love", "calming", "sadness" or "gratitude". Indicates which standardized touch expression / video was presented.
  + response: text. When task is "forced choice", this variable can take the values "attention", "happiness", "love", "calming", "sadness", "gratitude" or "other". When task is "free text" it can take any value. Indicates the participant's response to this stimulus.
  
* "pleas-data.csv" : data from both online and in-person/live studies, relating to the pleasantness ratings. Participants felt or watched videos of standardized touch expressions and rated how pleasant the touch was /would be. There is one row for each touch/video + response. There were 6 unique touch expressions, making 6 rows per participant.  
  + experiment: text. "felt touch" or "viewed touch", indicating the live or online study. 
  + PID: text. Unique participant ID. For the online study, this was generated by qualtrics.
  + group: text, "Control" or "ASD". Indicates which group the participant belongs to.
  + task: text, "forced choice" or "free text". Indicates which task condition the participant was randomly assigned to in the touch communication task. Only online study participants could be assigned to the "free text" task. 
  + Experimenter: integer 1-3, a code indicating which of three trained experimenters delivered the touch expressions.
  + trial: integer, 1-60. Indicates the trial order, the order in which the touches/videos were presented to each participant. Max 6 when experiment is "viewed touch"
  + cued: text, "attention", "happiness", "love", "calming", "sadness" or "gratitude". Indicates which standardized touch expression / video was presented.
  + response: numeric, ranging from -10 to 10. Reflects the location on a visual analog scale (VAS) where the participant clicked to indicate pleasantness of the touch. The ends of the line were labelled "unpleasant" on the left end (coded as -10), and "pleasant" on the right end (coded as 10). No other marks were present on the line.
